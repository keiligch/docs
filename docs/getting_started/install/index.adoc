= Install KOMMA from the update site

Installing KOMMA from the update site is easy!

At first you have to get a current version of 
http://www.eclipse.org[Eclipse]. In this tutorial I am 
using Eclipse 4.4 Standard for Linux (64bit). 

Afterwards you can install KOMMA by clicking on 
__Help > Install New Software__. Use the following update site.
