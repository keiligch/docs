= Install KOMMA from the update site

Installing KOMMA is from the update site is easy!

At first you have to get a current version of 
http://www.eclipse.org[Eclipse]. In this tutorial I am 
using Eclipse Kepler Standard for Linux (64bit). 

Afterwards you can install KOMMA by clicking on 
__Help > Install New Software__. Use the following update site.

Afterwards you have to restart your Eclipse application. Eventually 
you are able to use the KOMMA Editor. 

You can test your installation by switching to the OWL perspective. 
Just click __Window > Open Perspective > Other__
